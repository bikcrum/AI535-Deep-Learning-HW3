## Assignment 3

### Steps to run the code
1. Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Make sure you have the following training and test data:
   1. `cifar10_hst_test`
   2. `cifar10_hst_val`
   3.  `cifar10_hst_test`]
3. To train a CNN model run `python cifar_pytorch.py`
4. To evaluate a CNN model with test set run `python test.py`
5. To train a LSTM model run `python driver_parity.py`
6. To test a hand-coded LSTM model run `python univariate_tester.py`
